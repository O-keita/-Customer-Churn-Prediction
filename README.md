# Customer Churn Prediction

## **Project Overview**

The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (i.e., stop using the company's services). By accurately predicting churn, businesses can proactively address customer needs and implement strategies to enhance retention.

## **Objectives**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Collect historical customer data including features such as gender, age, tenure, phone service, and internet service.
   - Clean and preprocess the data: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct exploratory analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.
   - Visualize key features and their impact on customer churn.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features and transform existing ones to improve the model's predictive power.
   - Select the most relevant features influencing customer churn.

4. **Model Development:**
   - Train various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) to predict churn.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Model Optimization and Validation:**
   - Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
   - Ensure model robustness and generalizability on unseen data.

6. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Analyze model results to identify key factors driving customer churn.
   - Provide actionable recommendations for improving customer retention and reducing attrition.

## **Expected Outcomes**

- A predictive model that accurately identifies customers at risk of churning.
- Insights into the factors contributing to customer churn.
- Strategic recommendations to enhance customer loyalty and reduce churn rates.

## **Tools and Technologies**

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Platforms:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab (if needed)

This project will provide valuable insights into customer behavior and enable businesses to implement effective retention strategies.
